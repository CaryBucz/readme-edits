This is the static, self contained HTML blogpage design.

I do not know how to bring in the data file referenced so I hardcoded the entire thing.  I am hoping there is an app to write and reaign the data to the classes I defined so this would be a dynamic load into my general formatting.

I also could not link my CSS style page properly so I just put it at the start of the file.

The last sofware coding I had done was in robotic C controls, three years ago.

I do hope this demonstrates how I can teach myself anything in a short period to get a job done.
